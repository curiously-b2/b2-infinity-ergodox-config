# b2-infinity-ergodox-config
Colemak-based keyboard layout for Infinity ErgoDox
-----
Since I've had several people ask, I figured I'd upload the KLL files for my custom config.  This is pretty much always a work in progress; I'm basically iterating on the layout and making changes as things become bothersome.

This is relatively mature at this point; I started iterating on this layout in October of 2015, so most of the little irritants have been worked out of the layout.
